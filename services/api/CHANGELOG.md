## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Default-off Lens B outcome feedback capture (IND-434): verified explicit human
  owner accept/reject actions are recorded as idempotent, append-only events
  scoped to the recipient's OWN intent, written atomically inside the winning
  owner-action transition (rollback → no event; commit → exactly one). Capture
  is gated on session-authenticated provenance, a presentation-approved cached
  recipient summary, one unique non-introducer counterpart, and an exact or
  unambiguous recipient-owned actor intent. Agent/API-key, ambiguous multiparty,
  and raw-evaluator-only actions never become preferences. The transaction
  share-locks and revalidates the intent revision immediately before insertion;
  shadow mining repeats ownership, lifecycle, fingerprint, and event-integrity
  checks before running and emits redacted, threshold-safe aggregate telemetry
  only. Outcome history is retained across routine intent/opportunity deletion
  (no cascading source foreign keys); only user deletion erases it.
