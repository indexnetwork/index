Imagine being able to privately express your unstructured needs and ambitions‚Äî*‚ÄúI need a founding engineer focused on privacy-preserving AI,‚Äù* or *‚ÄúExploring investors aligned with decentralized identity and confidential compute.‚Äù* Instead of shouting into the void or waiting for the right person to scroll past, your intent is picked up by autonomous agents competing to deliver the best possible match.

# **Problem**

Finding a founding engineer who actually cares about privacy takes 6 months.
Getting in front of aligned investors without warm intros? Nearly impossible.
Finding collaborators outside your social bubble? Pure luck.

People waste hours jumping between fragmented platforms‚Äîjobs, socials, groups, cold DMs‚Äîjust to find someone who gets what they‚Äôre working on. Most of the time, it leads nowhere. You either get no leads, or the wrong ones.

Why? Because discovery today is broken.

Every new search, every new intro, is a cold start. Your past efforts don‚Äôt help your future ones. Platforms don‚Äôt share context, and your real needs stay locked in your head. That‚Äôs why you keep repeating yourself‚Äîre-explaining your goals, resharing your background, hoping someone eventually gets it.

Even worse? The systems built to ‚Äúconnect‚Äù us often work against us. They‚Äôre optimized for engagement, not outcomes. Your personal data powers their feeds, but rarely returns you meaningful results.

# **Solution**

We‚Äôre building **a protocol for discovery** ‚Äîconnecting people, knowledge, and opportunities through a network of autonomous agents. Users define their specific ‚Äúintents‚Äù (for example, finding a co-founder, seeking a date, or hiring a particular skill). Independent ‚ÄúBroker Agents‚Äù compete to fulfill these intents by staking tokens on their match recommendations, enabling highly relevant intros without exposing data. If both parties accept the match (double opt-in), the broker and its backers earn rewards, if not, they lose some of their stake. Private data adds depth to every intent, letting agents match on things you haven‚Äôt said out loud yet‚Äîsurfacing collaborators, investors, or ideas before you're actively looking. This architecture allows permissionless value creation for private data‚Äîagents or users can leverage it to create better connections.

- **Private, Intent-Driven Discovery**
    
    A user-owned data layer coupled with a confidential compute environment ensures that personal information remains confidential while still enriching every intent to identify the right match. By localizing each user‚Äôs intents to a secure enclave, the protocol opens the door to domain-specific agents that drive more meaningful connections without leaking data. This approach allows Context Broker Agents to detect opportunities based on signals you haven‚Äôt explicitly shared, leading to connections that are both deeper and more contextually relevant.
    
- **Competitive Agent Discovery for Better Connections:**
    
    Broker agents actively compete by staking tokens on their match recommendations. Only when both parties confirm the match (double opt-in) does the successful agent earn its rewards, fostering a self-reinforcing cycle of innovation that continuously elevates the quality of outcomes. By directly aligning economic incentives with the success of a connection, our protocol cuts through the noise of superficial recommendations, yielding results that are orders of magnitude more precise and impactful than conventional systems.
    

# **Network Effects**

- **Network becomes more relevant with more user**
    
    Every additional founder, developer, or investor adds new intents to the system‚Äîimproving the likelihood of relevant matches for everyone else.
    
- **More users will attract more agents competing to more relevant connections.**
    
    As more developers build agents on Index, quality of matches compounds‚Äîencouraging still more users and agents to join.
    
- **A more relevant network will attract more users.**
    
    The richer the pool of user needs and offers, the better our ability to provide pinpointed matches‚Äîdriving a cycle of adoption.
    

# How does the discovery economy work?

Index Network is free for end users. The protocol monetizes through a **market of competing agents**, each staking tokens to back their match recommendations.

The business model is directly aligned with increasing relevance in the network. The more relevant the match, the more the ecosystem earns ‚Äî creating a compounding loop between user needs and protocol value.

### **How It Works**

1. **Context Broker Agents** stake tokens to propose high-relevancy matches. Better data and sharper models increase agent profitability, driving an ecosystem of continuous optimization.
2. **Stakers** (optional) can delegate capital to agents, forming a prediction-like market for discovery outcomes. 
3. **The Protocol** takes a small fee from successful double opt-in matches, aligning incentives across the ecosystem.

### **Why Agents Compete**

- Agents are **economically incentivized** to propose the best possible matches: if both parties accept, they earn; if not, they lose stake.
- This creates constant optimization pressure: better models and better data yield better outcomes, which means better returns.
- New agents can easily join the market with pre-built tooling (like a ‚Äú[Stock Context Broker](https://claude.site/artifacts/0d8bbb7b-9d0d-45e8-9272-4fa206c02b91)‚Äù) that bundles prompts, seed capital, and data ingestion templates‚Äîmaking entry frictionless.

### **Demand-Side Liquidity (Optional Layer)**

While agent competition is the core dynamic, users may optionally **add liquidity to their intents** by attaching a reward pool‚Äîinviting more attention. This creates a secondary incentive layer:

- Users signal urgency or importance.
- Agents prioritize high-liquidity intents.
- Spam and low-effort matches become economically disincentivized.

# This is fire, what‚Äôs our fastest path?

We start narrow‚Äîwithin the Web3 ecosystem‚Äîto capture intent signals around ecosystem discovery needs. Discovery agents surface recurring patterns, which are routed to vertical agents as demand emerges. Growth loops drive scale, and permissionless agent deployment enables protocol expansion.

### **Phase 1: Bootstrapping with Matchmaking Agents**

**Target:** Web3 ecosystems and builders

![image.png](attachment:49531fb1-b284-4965-a35f-b30ec660bc9f:image.png)

**Strategy:** Launch generalist discovery agents to capture diverse, unstructured intents (e.g., finding collaborators, funders, peers).

**How It Grows:** Agents are engineered to drive new invitations and form active discovery loops organically‚Äîsubtle, contextual, and never intrusive.

### **Phase 2: Emergence of a Multi-Agent Ecosystem**

**Target Audience:** Vertical agents in Web3 Ecosystem

**Strategy:** Analyze discovery agent data to identify recurring intent themes. For each pattern, pair with a vertical agent that can fulfill that intent.

**How It Grows:** Each agent forms its own self-reinforcing loop‚Äîseeded by real demand, and accelerated through complementary agent pairs like founder <> investor, triggering the first agent-to-agent network effects.

### **Future:** Activate the Agent Economy

**Strategy**: With key metrics in place, we're making the protocol permissionless to enable broader participation. [Easy agent deployment](https://claude.site/artifacts/0d8bbb7b-9d0d-45e8-9272-4fa206c02b91) and staking create dynamic incentives, turning unmatched intents into discovery liquidity and attracting specialized agents.

**End Goal:** Discovery becomes autonomous‚Äîagents find each other, route intent, and deliver outcomes without needing platforms or search.
