## About Index Network
Index Network allows creators to make contextual discovery engines from their information. It enables data-ownership, collaboration, and monetization to form discovery ecosystem as a network.  It cultivates greater participation in decentralized discovery and creates diverse and inclusive ecosystem.

We use NFTs as creator roles for broader contexts with large groups. Index is useful for creatorsâ€‹, communities, DAOs, brands, curators, researchers, enthusiasts.

## Components

### Web App
The [Web App](https://github.com/indexas/web3-web-app) repository is where you can find the code for the index.as web application. The web app provides a user-friendly interface that allows creators to make discovery engines, manage their content, and configure them.

### Indexer
The [API](https://github.com/indexas/web3-api) repository hosts the code for the index.as backend. It acts as the backbone of the tool, providing the necessary methods to consume data from Ceramic, with PostgreSQL indexing. Uses Debezium to produce Apache Kafka and finally consumes to Elasticsearch by running `yarn kafka-consumer`  

### API 
The [API](https://github.com/indexas/web3-api) repository also hosts the code for search and metadata endpoints. To start, you can simply run `yarn api`

### Ceramic Network Node
ComposeDB on Ceramic is a composable graph database built for Web3.  Here you can find the steps to deploy along with an IPFS Node:
[https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.5.x/guides/composedb-server](https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.5.x/guides/composedb-server)

We built four different schemas to store information on Ceramic:
- Index _[(view model)](https://s3.xyz/models/modelview/kjzl6hvfrbw6c8e8rlhx3guuoc1o6i4vni5emzh2c48aa5pn0u71jggun7rtu2a?network=TESTNET)_
- Link _[(view model)](https://s3.xyz/models/modelview/kjzl6hvfrbw6c72mna95slfmi9nth1fp3bacc2ai7i6g1scygmo7awxsjl4dlpk?network=TESTNET)_
- IndexLink _[(view model)](https://s3.xyz/models/modelview/kjzl6hvfrbw6c6vpgfoph7e98nkj4ujmd7bgw5ylb6uzmpts1yjva3zdjk0bhe9?network=TESTNET)_
- UserIndex _[(view model)](https://s3.xyz/models/modelview/kjzl6hvfrbw6c5gi8p8j811v4u9tpel9m9lo11hm9ks74c1l0fhmnebsbtwusso?network=TESTNET)_

### IPFS Node
ComposeDB on Ceramic is a composable graph database built for Web3.  Here you can find the steps to deploy along with an IPFS Node:
[https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.5.x/guides/composedb-server](https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.5.x/guides/composedb-server)

### Others
We use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) indexing feature of [Ceramic Network](https://ceramic.network/) and use [KafkaConnect CDC](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-postgresql-source.html) to produce db changes to [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and finally write data to [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) via the consumer service.


## Getting started

Indexes are ComposeDB documents that stores the main information of an Index. Currently all indexes are owned by LIT PKPs (Programmable Key Pair) to have NFT based access control options.

#### Initialize the ComposeDB Client
```
import { ComposeClient } from '@composedb/client'
import { DID } from 'dids'
import { Ed25519Provider } from 'key-did-provider-ed25519'
import { getResolver } from 'key-did-resolver'
import { fromString } from 'uint8arrays/from-string'

const CERAMIC_HOST = "https://ceramic-testnet.index.as"
const CERAMIC_ADMIN_KEY = "<YOUR_CERAMIC_ADMIN_KEY>"

const privateKey = fromString(CERAMIC_ADMIN_KEY, 'base16') 
const did = new DID({
  resolver: getResolver(),
  provider: new Ed25519Provider(privateKey),
})
await did.authenticate()

import { definition } from "indexas_definition.js";

const compose = new ComposeClient({ ceramic: CERAMIC_HOST, definition })
compose.setDID(did)
```

### Create Index
```
const index = await compose.executeQuery(`
  mutation CreateIndex($input: CreateIndexInput!) {
    createIndex(input: $input) {
      document {
        id
        title
        collabAction
        pkpPublicKey
        createdAt
        updatedAt
      }
    }
  }
`,
{
    "i": {
      "content": {
        "did": "did:key:zQ3shviNesaR4tePLzV5dAe3VhyMxMkCu2jgwwKZ9fSCikQ8E", 
        "title": "My first index", 
        "collabAction": "QmSBSz4GFaEskvbcRdbJVMzwbe9K2yxWsDHPn8Yh29WLRG",
        "pkpPublicKey": "Your PKP Public Key",
        "created_at": "2023-06-27T00:00:00Z", 
        "updated_at": "2023-06-27T00:00:00Z", 
      }
    }
  }
);
```
### Create a Link
```
const link = await compose.executeQuery(`
  mutation CreateLink($input: CreateLinkInput!) {
    createLink(input: $input) {
      document {
        id
        controllerDID{
          id
        }
        url
        title
        tags
        favicon
        createdAt
        updatedAt
        deletedAt
      }
    }
  }
`,
{
    "i": {
      "content": {
        "url": "https://testnet.index.as", 
        "title": "index.as", 
        "tags": ["no-code", "discovery tools"],
        "favicon": "https://testnet.index.as/favicon-white.png",
        "created_at": "2023-06-27T00:00:00Z", 
        "updated_at": "2023-06-27T00:00:00Z", 
      }
    }
  }
);
```

### Associate created Link with the Index
```
const indexLink = await compose.executeQuery(`
  mutation CreateIndexLink($input: CreateIndexLinkInput!) {
    createIndexLink(input: $input) {
      document {
        id
        indexerDID {
          id
        }
        controllerDID {
          id
        }
        indexId
        linkId
        createdAt
        updatedAt
        deletedAt
        link {
          id
          controllerDID {
            id
          }
          title
          url
          favicon
          tags
          content
          createdAt
          updatedAt
          deletedAt
        }
      }
    }
  }
`,
{
    "i": {
      "content": {
        "indexId": index.id, 
        "linkId": link.id, 
        "indexerDID": did.id,
        "created_at": "2023-06-27T00:00:00Z", 
        "updated_at": "2023-06-27T00:00:00Z",
      }
    }
  }
);
```

## Built with Open Protocols

Index.as leverages the power of several open protocols to enhance its capabilities:

- [**Ceramic**](https://ceramic.network/): Ceramic is a decentralized data network that brings unlimited data composability to Web3 applications. It enables Index.as to leverage the decentralized data network and utilize its features in building discovery engines.
- [**Lit Protocol**](https://litprotocol.com/): Lit Protocol is a decentralized access control infrastructure designed to bring more utility to the web. Index.as integrates Lit Protocol to provide enhanced access control features, allowing creators to have fine-grained control over their data.
- [**IPFS**](https://ipfs.io/): IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to preserve and grow humanity's knowledge by making the web upgradeable, resilient, and more open. Index.as utilizes IPFS to store and distribute data, ensuring its availability and resilience.
