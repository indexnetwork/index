# index.as

## The human bridge between context and content.

index.as helps you to curate all-forms of content, create searchable indexes, and monetize them independently.

### Create your indexes by adding any content you like and find relevant.

- Index articles, documents, NFTs, photos, videos, tweets and any other
  kind of content.
-  Index the web with a browser extension

### If you index it, then search it. Welcome to your refined search engine. Filter your indexes, and search as you type.

- Filter your index by date, type, or any tag you want.
- index.as will support semantically described content types such as person, company, event, place, etc.

### Collaborate on two-person projects up to DAO-scale. Monetize independently.

- Specify on-chain criteria like "user must hold an NFT" and the network will provide permission to those who meet those criteria.
- Monetize your index with your own terms by composing access control conditions.
