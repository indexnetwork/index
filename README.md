## About Index Network

Index Network is a decentralized discovery protocol that enables personalized and autonomous information retrieval through a composable vector database and an agent-based query engine.

To achieve this, Index provides a decentralized semantic index that eliminates data fragmentation, a composable discovery protocol that allows data to be queried from multiple sources, in a user-centric manner. On top of this, it provides a real-time environment for agents that facilitates integration with algorithms and services and ensures that information acquires a fluid, social, and autonomous structure.

## Example

To illustrate, here is an example of an agent message thatâ€™s possible using Index Network:

## Components

### Indexer

The [Indexer](indexer) component hosts the code for the indexer. It acts as the backbone of the natural language operations, providing the necessary methods to consume data from Ceramic, interact with large language models. It listenes Apache Kafka to consume Ceramic Network events consumes to ChromaDB by running `yarn consumer`

### API

The [API](api) repository also hosts the code for all the API operations To start, you can simply run `yarn api`

Full protocol documentation can be found on the [Index Network documentation site â†’](https://docs.index.network)

### Ceramic Network Node

ComposeDB on Ceramic is a composable graph database built for Web3. Here you can find the steps to deploy along with an IPFS Node:
[https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.6.x/guides/composedb-server](https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.6.x/guides/composedb-server)

### IPFS Node

ComposeDB on Ceramic is a composable graph database built for Web3. Here you can find the steps to deploy along with an IPFS Node:
[https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.6.x/guides/composedb-server](https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.6.x/guides/composedb-server)

### Others

We use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) indexing feature of [Ceramic Network](https://ceramic.network/) and use [KafkaConnect CDC](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-postgresql-source.html) to produce db changes to [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and finally write data to [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) via the consumer service.

## Getting started

This code snippet demonstrates how to interact with the protocol using the Index client. It begins by initializing the client for and authenticating with a DID session. Then, it creates an index titled "Future of publishing" and a web page titled "Post medium publishing" with a specified URL. The code adds the web page to the index and performs a natural language query using the keyword "summarize," retrieving and displaying the natural language query response.

```js
const indexClient = new Index({
  network: "testnet",
});

indexClient.authenticate(session);

// Create an index
const indexId = await indexClient.createIndex({
  title: "Future of publishing",
  signerPublicKey: "0x047955f0df748d..1708fc8c965",
  signerFunction: "QmaD9FZJYst2Tntf9UwSd3QUeD68XpaPhKBSyy5wWLHq2m",
});

// Create a web page
const webPageId = await indexClient.createWebPage({
  title: "Post medium publishing",
  url: "http://www.paulgraham.com/publishing.html",
});

// Add the web page to the index
await indexClient.addIndexItem(indexId, webPageId);

// Perform a natural language query
const queryResponse = await indexClient.query({
  query: "summarize",
  indexes: [indexId],
});

console.log("Query response:", queryResponse);
```

```json
{
  "response": "This article discusses the intricacies and challenges of publishing in the modern digital era, emphasizing the importance of content quality and audience engagement. The author shares insights from personal experiences and outlines strategies for successful online publishing.",
  "sources": [
    {
      "itemId": "kjzl6kcym7w8y7fjc89gmnkne7qpdz5ws5ryfji3i8dndjh2wxuii7z1anybovo",
      "indexId": "indexIdValue"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Built with Open Protocols

Index Network leverages the power of several open protocols to enhance its capabilities:

- [**Ceramic**](https://ceramic.network/): Ceramic is a decentralized data network that brings unlimited data composability to Web3 applications. It enables Index Network to leverage the decentralized data network and utilize its features in building discovery engines.
- [**Lit Protocol**](https://litprotocol.com/): Lit Protocol is a decentralized access control infrastructure designed to bring more utility to the web. Index Network integrates Lit Protocol to provide enhanced access control features, allowing creators to have fine-grained control over their data.
- [**IPFS**](https://ipfs.io/): IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to preserve and grow humanity's knowledge by making the web upgradeable, resilient, and more open. Index Network utilizes IPFS to store and distribute data, ensuring its availability and resilience.
